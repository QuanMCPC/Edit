___
## Orgin (Not orgin of Microsoft edit)
> It started out as an idea in my mind when I'm still developing the console. `Seeing a native text editor in a lot of operating system, I should develop my own native text editor for console` - I think. So I start develop, and after a lot of error, a lot of bug. I offically release edit on `Friday, 23rd 2020`.
## In a JS file
> After that, `What if people want to include edit in other website?` - I question my self. So I bundled edit into a JavaScript file that you can include in the HTML file and download [`here`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QuanMCPC/QuanMCPC.github.io/master/other_project/Edit_For_Other_Website.js)
## As a program
> And then, I found out about [`Electron`](https://electronjs.org) and [`NodeJS`](https://nodejs.org/) that allow people to make program using HTML, CSS and JS but with more control then ever. So with a lot more code and some modification, I have able to make edit an offical program.
## Thing edit can do
 - Includes all features in Windows's notepad
 - Has a theme changer (Very basic)
 - Check for update
## Thing edit can't do
 - Auto-complete code
 - Fancy text formatting
 - Source Control build-in
 - Bake a cake
## Issues
 - Insane lag when handling large amount of text (Not fixed)
### Have fun using edit!
